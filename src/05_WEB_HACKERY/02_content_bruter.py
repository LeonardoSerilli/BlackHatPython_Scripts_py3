"""
In a lot of cases there are configuration files, leftover development files, debugging scripts, and 
other security breadcrumbs that can provide sensitive information or expose functionality that
the software developer did not intend.

The tool will accept wordlists from common brute forcers such as:
- SVNDigger https://www.invicti.com/blog/web-security/svn-digger-better-lists-for-forced-browsing/

It will then attempt to discover directories and files that are reachable on the target web server.

NOTE: itâ€™s useful to react to the output because, you may have to filter out more HTTP error codes in order to clean it up
